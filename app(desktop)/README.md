# Photo Library (Desktop)
Welcome to my desktop app guide. All the features are listed below. Feel free to roam around!

*[shortcut to the source code](./src/main/java/com/example/bro_comm/)*
## Overview
Photo Library gives you the power to create and manage albums directly from images stored on your computer. You can move and copy photos between your albums. You can edit your photos with captions and tags. You can even view your collection with a built-in slideshow. Above all, it supports multiple users! 

This application comes preconfigured with a stock user that contains a stock album and five breathtaking stock photos.

## Implementation
This application was written in java using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) and [Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/). 

## Data Management
Data persistence is achieved through [serialization](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html). 

## Administration
The administration system allows you to manage users.  
To configure, simply enter **"admin"** at login.

## Albums
Logging into a user displays all the user's albums. Here you can select a specific album to display the number of photos in the album as well as the range of modification dates.

You can easily add, delete or rename albums.
