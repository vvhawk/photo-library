# Photo Library ðŸ“¸
Welcome to my first app! Here, youâ€™ll find a traditional photo library reimagined as a colorful adventure!

This started as a project for my university class on software methodology. While we were only graded on functionality, my partner and I took it to the next level by prioritizing how it looked.  

With everything I create, I strive to make it pretty to look at. Design is essential to me. The basis for our design was to use colors to designate the application's various functions. Iâ€™ve included the initial storyboard and UML diagram from the planning phase. 

**NOTE:**  
*The application has a desktop and mobile version with slightly different functionality. The README files serve as guides to these functionalities. If you have any further questions, feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/vvhawk)!*
